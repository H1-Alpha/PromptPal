## 🖥️ Frontend

- **Framework:** **Next.js (React + TypeScript)**
    - SEO-friendly (important for your marketplace).
    - Server-side rendering → good for landing pages & performance.
    - Large ecosystem + easy deployment with Vercel.
- **UI Library:** **TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui**
    - Clean, modern UI quickly.
    - shadcn gives you pre-built components (modals, cards, dropdowns).
- **State Management:** TanStack Query (React Query) for async + API handling.

## ⚙️ Backend

- **Framework:** **Node.js with NestJS** *(or Express if you want lighter)*
    - TypeScript end-to-end (matches frontend).
    - Easy to build APIs for prompt management, marketplace, user auth.
- **Database:** **PostgreSQL**
    - Great for structured data (prompts, tags, users, transactions).
    - Supports JSON fields for storing prompt metadata if needed.
- **ORM:** **Prisma**
    - Clean, developer-friendly.
    - Works perfectly with TypeScript.
- **Authentication:** **Clerk** or **Auth0** (or NextAuth if you want free).
    - Handles email, Google, GitHub login quickly.
- **Storage:**
    - Prompts + user data in PostgreSQL.
    - Files (if needed later, e.g. prompt packs) → AWS S3 or Supabase Storage.

## 🤖 AI Integration

- **OpenAI API** (for GPT-4/GPT-4o) — prompt generation, guidance.
- Optionally support Anthropic (Claude) or Cohere later for power users.
- **LangChain** (optional) for managing prompt workflows, testing, chaining.

## 🌐 Browser Extension

- **Tech:** **React + TypeScript (with Plasmo framework)**
    - Plasmo makes Chrome/Edge/Firefox extension development way faster.
    - Lets you inject a sidebar or popup to “save prompt” or “run prompt.”

## ☁️ Deployment & Infra

- **Frontend Hosting:** Vercel (perfect for Next.js).
- **Backend Hosting:** Render, Railway, or AWS/GCP (start with Render → cheaper, simpler).
- **Database:** Supabase (Postgres as a service, free tier + auth + storage if you want all-in-one).
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (easy automation).
